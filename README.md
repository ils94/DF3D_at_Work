# What is this?
This is a small program that will make it easier to execute the command necessary to authenticate you into Dead Frontier 3D Inner City.

# Why you made this?
I made this to work together with my Greasy Fork script: [Dead Frontier at work](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/468944-dead-frontier-at-work)

This program provides a simple interface for the user to save the deadfrontier.exe path and to put his/her authentication token to login into the Inner City.

# How does it works?
Put the Executable Path and your Authentication Token in the desired input fields like in the image below:

Then you press the "Login" button, wait for the Standalone Client to open, and then once it open, press the "Play!" button and wait for the server to authenticate you into the Inner City.
